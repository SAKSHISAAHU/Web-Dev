<!-- notes -->

<!-- An ID is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one HTML element within a page. It is often used for unique styling and JavaScript manipulations.
 
The class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements. That way, you can easily change their look or behavior all at once.

In CSS, elements with IDs are selected using a hash (#) symbol before the ID, and elements with classes are selected using a dot (.) before the class name.
